# Paxos Consensus Engine

## Introduction
The Paxos Consensus Engine is an implementation of the Paxos algorithm, a protocol for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors. Consensus algorithms like Paxos are essential in distributed systems and are used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or systems.

## Features
- **Implementation of Paxos Algorithm**: Detailed and efficient implementation of the Paxos consensus protocol.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures that the system continues to operate, even in the presence of a certain number of faulty processes.
- **Scalability**: Designed to work efficiently in large distributed systems.
